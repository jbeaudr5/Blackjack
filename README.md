# Blackjack
A web adaptation of the card game 'Blackjack'

OBJECTIVE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To get as close as possible to a score of 21 without going over

HOW TO PLAY
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The player is first prompted to enter their name <br/>
First 2 cards are automatically drawn <br/>
Player can then choose to hit (draw another card) or hold (keep their current score) <br/>
If the player hits and their score exceeds 21, they lose (bust) <br/>
Once the player holds, the dealer score will be generated as a number between 17 and 26* <br/>
If the player holds and their score is greater than the dealer's then the player wins (a tie goes to the dealer) <br/>
If the player holds and the dealer's score is over 21 then the player wins <br/>

CARD VALUES
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All number cards are worth their value <br/>
Aces can change throughout the round and can be worth either 1 or 11 (the program will automatically choose the most beneficial value) <br/>
Face cards are worth 10

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Dealer score is 17 to 26 because in a real game, the dealer must hit if their score is under 17. If their score is 16, the max they can draw is 10 (either the number 10 or a face card) so their max score is a 26. An ace would be worth 1 not 11 in this case (dealer would always pick 1 to avoid a bust).
